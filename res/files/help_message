Hello and welcome to the Network Simulation of NetSym!

This program allows you to simulate a computer network with ease and with style!
Simply create the devices you desire, connect them, and start sending packets!

To create a device, open the "Device Creation Window" using the button on the side menu or
press 'e' on your keyboard, There you can select the device you wish to create.
On the buttons in that window you can see keyboard shortcuts, these work also outside of the window.

Once some device are created, you can drag them around and display them on the side menu.
You can move which device is displayed using the arrow keys.
To move a device around, use CTRL + arrows.

To connect the computers press the "connect computers" button, and then press the two
computers you want to connect one after the other.
You can also use CTRL + C to use "smart connect", which will connect each endpoint computer to
his nearby switch, and SHIFT + c to connect every device to every other device.

When you display a device or any object in the side menu, you have some options for it,
For computers you can change the IP address or add or remove an interface, etc...
You can also press the network interfaces of the devices, and so configure a new MAC address,
start or stop sniffing on that interface, and more!
You can select packets, and then drop them mid way! amazing (you might want to pause the simulation
in order to do that, press the SPACE BAR)

And that's it! your'e a NetSym pro!!!
